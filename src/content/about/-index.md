## Building Quality Outdoor Structures Since 2008

At Eco Shack, our shacks are built from locally sourced and milled timber and materials. Customers are encouraged to share in the experience, contributing to the design and build process.

We create spare rooms, bedrooms, sheds, studios, shelters, and everything in between. Since 2008, Eco Shack has been a Tasmanian leader in the rapidly growing market for smart, well-designed, prefabricated backyard structures.

## Our Workshop & Process

Our workshop is based in Ranelagh, in the beautiful Huon Valley. Here, we prefabricate all our shacks as flat packs, allowing for minimal on-site installation time. This means our shacks can be installed in most locations on your property without the need for heavy machinery or cranes.

Our innovative prefabricated panel system speeds up the building process while ensuring every design meets your needs. Eco Shack offers a simple, efficient solution that brings your backyard vision to life quickly and easily.

Thanks to our streamlined process and modular designs, installation is rapid—from concept to completion in a fraction of the time of traditional construction. We have completed projects across Tasmania and interstate.

## Quality Craftsmanship & Customisation

At Eco Shack, we combine innovative design with quality craftsmanship to create structures built to last. Your investment is tailored to you, with flat-packed panels offering hundreds of customisation options. Choose from different sizes, door and window placements, and colours—all thoughtfully designed to work together.

We also provide add-ons to enhance your shack, including composting toilets, plumbing, wood burners, 240V power, and off-grid solar equipment. We can even supply custom furniture designed to suit your shack.
