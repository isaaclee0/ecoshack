#### Blackman's Bay Studio

Completed this little beauty for a customer in Blackmans Bay. 2.6x3.4 Garden Studio, clad in Macrocarpa and Corrugated iron, fully lined, sound proofed and insulated. Double glazed doors and windows. Delivered flat packed, completed in 2.5 days, just the power to go. 

We have a range of Eco Shack display shacks available for sale, all manufactured in the Huon Valley using local and Tasmanian materials where possible. We invite you to visit our Eco Shack village in Ranelagh to see them in person. 
All our shacks are manufactured as flat packs and assembled on-site, making no location too difficult. We offer delivery and installation services across Tasmania. 

In addition to our ready-made options, we can also discuss our flat-pack range or create a custom build designed exactly to your preferences.

**Customization Options:**
All our shacks offer a variety of choices including size, lining, insulation, cladding style, gable or skillion roof, and window and door sizes. You can choose to purchase a flat pack for self-assembly or have us complete the installation from start to finish. Costs will vary depending on your selected style, windows, doors, cladding, and other features. 

We have licensed plumbers and electricians available to assist with lighting, power, and plumbing requirements. 

**Please Note:** While we are happy to discuss your needs, customers are responsible for their own due diligence in adhering to council guidelines.
