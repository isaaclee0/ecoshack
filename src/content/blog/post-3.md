#### Cabin and Bathroom

West Coast road trip! The Ecoshack team headed to the rugged West Coast of Tasmania, to install a prefabricated off-grid cabin and bathroom. Clad in a blend of corrugated iron and locally milled Macrocarpa. Cabin fully insulated, lined, solar powered, and kept warm by a cute little wood heater. Bathroom included a shower, vanity, and a Green Loo composting toilet. All manufactured in the Huon Valley, Tasmania.
